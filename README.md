### Narcyz-Path

Howdy! I'm Narcyz, as you could guess. 
Welcome to my new Game...ugh, no..
Welcome to my new Game Engine...ugh, still not..
Welcome to my new Game to be...fuck, that's still not that accurate..
Welcome to my new maybe Game maybe to be!

As you can see, for the moment, I have only taken care of the physics, the graphic content did not matter at that moment.
That is for a reason - I don't really care about graphic content for now. 


### How to play
It is a simple WSAD/ZQSD game, only I haven't programmed how to change keys yet, so it is a WSAD game.
It is a sandbox, a small one, but still, where only walls, spawners and mobs exist for the moment..oh! And the player too!

Your only way to have a something far from fun is to kill all the enemies! Only one spawner exists, it is in the location just
above the spawn.

To perform attacks, use the arrow keys. 

If you want to exit the game, just close the window or press escape.


### Goal
You are the blue rectangle and your enemies are the black rectangles. Everyone of you has a health bar under you. 
Black enemies cast grey area attacks around them if they touch you, but don't worry, they need to charge the attack first,
giving you the time to escape. You can attack as well, in the for main directions (north, east, south, west), you have to
charge time at all, but you can attack only in the given direction. 
If you die, you will loose. Killing all the enemies has no point since they spawn infinitely as long as you stay close enough 
to the spawner. 
Also, killing enemies gives you nothing. 
As I said, it is only a game engine for the moment, which means it has only to take care of physics.


### Warning
Please do not read the text message written in the spawn location.
